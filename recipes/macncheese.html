    <h2>Easy Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>This smoked macaroni and cheese recipe is more of a how-to. While I use prepared mac and cheese for ease, by all means use homemade if you chooseâ€“it will only be that much better.</p>
    <p>This takes on smoke flavor quickly and compliments smoked ribs, chicken, and brisket. Stick it on the smoker in the last hour of smoke time on your meat. By the time the meat is rested, this is ready to go.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Prepared macaroni and cheese:</b> 1 (20 ounce) package prepared macaroni and cheese, thawed if frozen</li>
        <li><b>American cheese:</b> 1 slice American cheese, quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Preheat oven:</b> Preheat an electric smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and add wood chips according to manufacturers directions. Use any wood chips that you would use for smoking meat.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare macaroni and cheese:</b> If prepared macaroni and cheese is not already in a heatproof dish, spoon it into a dish that can sit directly on the rack of a smoker. Divide cheese slices over the top.</li>
        <li><b>Place the dish in the smoker:</b> Place the dish directly on the rack of the smoker, and smoke until hot and bubbly, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
